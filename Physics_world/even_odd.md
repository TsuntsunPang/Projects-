## In primary shcool, we knew that the integer are divided into odd and even numbers. Those numbers are divisible by 2 called even number.  Numbers are not divisible by 2 called odd number. The sets of even and odd nubers are given by  
Eₙ = { 2n | n ∈ ℤ },  Oₙ = { 2n+1 | n ∈ ℤ }
## respetively. The  difference of even and odd is ubiquitous in physics and mathematics.  Here we list some examples.
# 1. inteference in optics
# 2. Mastubara Frequency
# 3. The string hypothesis in Bethe ansatz
# 4. statistical angle in quantum mechnaics 
# 5. Riemann Zeta function
## The definition  of Riemann Zeta function is given by 
$$\zeta(n)=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{m^n}$$
## when the arguments are even,we can write the Zeta function in compact form,namely 
$$\zeta(2n)=(-1)^{n+1}\frac{B_{2n}(2\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!}$$
## where $B_{2n}$ are Bernoulli numbers. However,we can not write $\zeta(2n+1)$ in compact form. That is so strange. Why the God arrange ?
