## The XXZ model can be solved through coordinate Bethe ansatz (CBA),assuming the eigenstate of Hamitonian is the superposition of plane wave. The Hamitonian for spin-1/2 XXZ model in one dimension is given by 
 $$H_{XXZ}=-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{L}(\sigma_i^x\sigma_{i+1}^{x}+\sigma_i^y\sigma_{i+1}^y+\Delta \sigma_i^z\sigma_{i+1}^z)$$
## Here we take Yang-Yang notation. Where $\Delta$ is anisotropy papameter. The two-body scattering matrix $S(k_j,k_l)$ can be calculated as 
$$
S(k_j,k_l)=\frac{1-2\Delta e^{ik_j}+e^{i(k_j+k_l)}}{1-2\Delta e^{ik_l}+e^{i(k_j+k_l)}}
$$
## Where $k_j,k_l$ are momentums. We can write down the Bethe equation easily once we know the scattering matrix.
